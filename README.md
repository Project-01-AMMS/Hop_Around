# pregame-and-party

## Description

Pregame and Party is a website that allows a user to search for a city and receive information on events and breweries local to that area. Brewery information provides users the address, phone number, and website for local breweries. While the event information provides users the event name, date, time, venue, and a link for ticket info. Finally, users can save to local storage their favorite options for future reference.
